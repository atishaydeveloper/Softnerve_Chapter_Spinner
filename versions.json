Le Moan, positioned at the bow, observed the consistent ocean swell, her mental focus directed towards the southern horizon where Karolin lay. Her innate sense of direction allowed her to ascertain Karolin\u2019s precise bearing. She maintained a clear and optimistic outlook, reassured by Sru\u2019s guarantee regarding Taori\u2019s safety and Peterson's confirmed departure. Her trust extended to Sru and Rantan, who had demonstrated kindness, and equally to Carlin and the Kanaka crew. Conversely, her initial apprehension toward Peterson\u2014rooted in his appearance, gruff voice, and Sru\u2019s prior remarks about his desire for the Karolin pearls\u2014had solidified into a deep distrust, now alleviated by his absence.\n\nLe Moan believed her protective charm, worn behind her ear, had facilitated these positive outcomes. She perceived the charm as having communicated directly with Sru, conveying details about the valuable pearls she had often encountered during her youth. She was convinced this talisman was instrumental in her current favorable circumstances and in Peterson\u2019s elimination from their voyage.\n\nAmidst this state of mental absorption, Le Moan experienced a vivid internal projection of Karolin's distinctive beach. This landscape, characterized by its whispering sands and palm fronds against varied skies, appeared clearly in her mind. Within this mental construct, she perceived Taori arriving by canoe, depicted with radiant red-gold hair and graceful movement\u2014a manifestation of her deepest desire. This vision suggested a preordained connection, revealing her singular life purpose.\n\nConcurrently, Carlin arrived on deck, joining Rantan. The previous night's events, specifically the broken cupboard and missing whiskey, remained an unspoken topic between them. Carlin observed a shark trailing the schooner, noting its unusual speed and lack of apparent swimming effort. This observation prompted a discussion with Rantan. Carlin expressed concern about sharks following vessels, but, hesitant to voice his deeper apprehension, he redirected the conversation to the ship's navigation.\n\nRantan, when pressed, admitted his own navigational limitations. He revealed that Le Moan, whom he identified as a \"Marayara,\" was the true navigator. He explained that Marayara individuals possess an extraordinary innate sense of direction, enabling them to return to their home island with remarkable precision, akin to a homing pigeon. He further clarified that Le Moan, being born and raised on Karolin, considered it the focal point of her existence. Sru had previously engaged her to guide the ship back, though Rantan speculated her compensation would be minimal. He emphasized that Le Moan\u2019s intuitive ability rendered the compass almost secondary, as she visually perceived their destination regardless of external factors like current or leeway.\n\nTo demonstrate her ability, Rantan instructed Le Moan to take the wheel. Upon assessing the ship's trajectory, she immediately adjusted the course by a few points, correcting the *Kermadec*'s deviation caused by leeway or current. From this moment, Le Moan assumed constant command of the ship's steering, exhibiting tireless focus. Her navigation was driven by an unwavering, instinctual connection to Karolin\u2014an invisible line that constantly reoriented the ship towards its destination, irrespective of any lateral drift. The sole limitation of this intuitive system was its lack of precise distance perception; she would not detect the island's imminent presence until alerted by a sensory cue, such as the sound of a reef.\n\nLe Moan's perception of time differed significantly from conventional human measurement. She did not conceptualize it in discrete units like hours or minutes but as a palpable, rhythmic manifestation of energy, evident in natural cycles such as tides, sunrises, and biological rhythms. This provided her with an inherent understanding of an ever-present reality, unburdened by abstract notions of past or future.\n\nDespite her unique temporal understanding, Le Moan readily grasped the compass's function. Rantan explained that the fleur-de-lys on the compass card, which she vaguely perceived as a fish spearhead, consistently pointed north, away from Karolin. Le Moan observed the card's apparent movement when the ship's course was altered, not realizing the card itself remained stationary and the ship pivoted around it. She interpreted the compass's consistent pointing away from Karolin as a sign of an adversarial entity within the binnacle\u2014a small deity or malevolent force opposing their return. This interpretation contrasted with Sru\u2019s practical, though superstitious, belief that a \"god\" resided within the compass, enforcing correct steering.\n\nRantan, meanwhile, maintained a navigational pretense. Daily at noon, he would perform a sextant observation of the sun, primarily to project an image of competence to the crew. Carlin, aware of Rantan's limited knowledge, would privately mock this performance. The crew, however, remained unaware that the ship's entire navigation relied on Le Moan.\n\nAt night, while at the wheel, Le Moan meticulously studied the compass card. She would intentionally deviate the ship's course to observe the card's consistent inverse rotation relative to the ship's turn, noting its unchanging behavior. This reinforced her belief that the binnacle's occupant, whether deity or demon, was perpetually hostile to their voyage towards Karolin, though this opposition seemed less pronounced during daylight hours.\n\nUnder Le Moan's unwavering guidance, the *Kermadec* proceeded steadily southward, marked by dramatic sunrises and sunsets. Finally, one morning, Le Moan handed the wheel to Rantan, indicating their destination. Karolin\u2019s lagoon, its light visibly brightening the distant sky, signaled the completion of her navigational task.",

            "Content": "Here's the refined chapter with added elements to make it more attractive for children, while keeping the original content undisturbed:\n\n## Chapter 5: Le Moan's Big Idea\n\nLe Moan didn't look back. She steered her little canoe, which felt as light as a feather, straight for the southern beach. On one side, sparkling water rushed in through the ocean gate with a happy gurgle, and white birds, looking like tiny snowflakes, fluttered and danced against the bright blue sky. On the other side was the big, calm lagoon, shimmering like a giant, peaceful mirror. Straight ahead was a quiet beach, an old village that wasn't used anymore, and some wild trees with wide, messy branches that looked exactly like tangled, green hair.\n\nShe pulled her light canoe onto the soft sand, far away from the water's edge. *Thump-thump!* went her heart with a little adventure beat. Then, she walked along the beach, past the whispering trees, and climbed up some rough, rocky coral. She stood there for a moment, looking out at the big, empty ocean, so wide it seemed to touch the edge of the world. Then, she turned around and looked across the lagoon. Far in the distance, on the other side, she could just see the shadowy trees of the northern beach.\n\nThe water in the lagoon was full and high, with pretty blue colors swirling in from the big ocean like melted gemstones. Le Moan could hear the water **swish-swish-swish** through the ocean gate, a softer sound different from the **CRASH!** of waves on the coral reef. Beyond the waves, she heard the birds crying their lonely calls. And even beyond the birds, there was only quiet, stretching all the way to the fluffy white clouds that looked like giant cotton balls in the sky.\n\nLe Moan was all by herself. She always felt a little different from the other people in her village, even though she lived with them and helped with fishing, cooking, and making mats. She talked and lived among them, but in a way, she was special, like someone with a secret superpower. She could stare into clear water and feel like she was part of it, just like the day a boy named Dick first saw her looking into the pond. Big, open spaces made her feel the same magical way. She also knew directions better than anyone, like the birds who always know their way home. It was as if her mind was truly magic, always connected to the wind, the sea, the sun, and the sparkling stars. She could even tell when a big storm was coming, with rumbling thunder far away, or when hungry tiger sharks might swim into the lagoon, or where shiny fish were hiding, far from the usual fishing spots. Her mind was like a special map and weather forecast all in one!\n\nAfter standing for a while and looking north, she walked back to the quiet, empty houses. She made herself some food, then fixed her fishing lines, making sure they were neat and tidy, and cleared annoying weeds from a patch of special plants. As the sun dipped down like a fiery ball and the stars began to pop out like tiny diamonds in the dark sky, Le Moan fell into a very deep sleep.\n\nUsually, Le Moan's dreams were happy and quiet, like a gentle song. But this morning, just before the sun began to peek, she had a strange dream. She saw a quiet boatman paddling a canoe towards her across a shiny lagoon, his paddle dipping softly. Then the dream floated away like a bubble, and Le Moan woke with a start! Her heart thumped **thump-thump-thump**, and her eyes were wide, even though it was still dim and sleepy, like the world was still snoozing.\n\nShe sat up. The sky was turning beautiful shades of pink and orange as the sun began to climb. Fishing birds were flying out to sea, their calls sounding like cheerful greetings over the distant **whoosh** of waves on the reef. Nothing else. Yet, she listened intently, her eyes fixed on the big fan of light spreading in the eastern sky, where the birds looked like tiny dark leaves blowing in the wind. *What was that feeling?* she wondered.\n\nNothing. The gentle sea breeze rustled the big, green leaves of the breadfruit trees and the rustly branches of the pandanus palms, then calmed. A new breeze began to blow from the land, cooler and fresher. The highest birds changed color in the growing light, turning from dark shapes to bright flashes of white, and the quiet lagoon seemed to come more alive, sparkling like a million tiny jewels.\n\nThe girl stood up and looked across the water. Nothing. Then she turned and walked quietly between the trees to the bumpy coral of the outer beach. And there, far out on the quiet sea, touched by the very first golden light of morning, she saw a HUGE ship! It looked like a giant white cloud floating on the water!\n\nShe had heard stories about other big ships that came to her island long, long ago, even before she was born. Once, a giant whaling ship came, its masts taller than any tree. The island chief, Uta Matu, fought them, and the ship barely escaped, leaving a trail of worry behind. Those big ships had always brought trouble, like dark storm clouds. Le Moan could still imagine that old fight, like a scary story she'd heard many times. And now, here was another ship! It looked different from the old ones, but it still made a worried, scared feeling grow and wiggle in her stomach, like a bunch of nervous butterflies.\n\nThe big ship had waited all night, silent and mysterious. It was a schooner, with tall sails reaching up, up, up into the sky. As the sun rose higher, the sails caught the light and turned a dazzling golden, as if spun from sunlight itself. The ship glowed on the sparkling blue sea, surrounded by birds that also looked golden in the light, whose cries sounded like cheerful singing, even if Le Moan's heart felt heavy.\n\nThen, the ship changed direction, its giant sails shifting, and a smaller boat dropped from its side with a little **splash!** It quickly raised a sail, and Le Moan, shielding her eyes from the bright, sunny glare, saw the little boat sailing straight for the island's entrance, moving so fast it left a foamy trail! She ran back into the trees and stood for a moment, pressing her hand to her forehead, trying to think. Her mind was a jumble of thoughts, like tangled fishing lines, but one thought was clear and strong, like a beacon: Taori!\n\nThis was danger! Her memory of the old, scary ships, and her special feeling about what was coming, told her so. She always knew directions without a compass, like magic, and she could feel when the weather would change or where fish would swim. This same strong feeling had woken her up with a thumping heart.\n\nThis was danger for Taori! As she stood there, the danger for Taori became clearer and sharper, like a picture coming into focus. She remembered not just Uta Matu's brave fight with the whaling ship, but also Taori's own words to Aioma about bad, bad men on another island. Taori had said they needed to build war canoes and get ready to fight, but the canoes weren't built, and the warriors weren't ready! And suddenly, here was this big boat with sails. Uta Matu and his mighty warriors were gone, and Taori was not prepared. Then, Le Moan had a clever thought, quick as a fish darting away: this little boat coming to the island was like a small fish that swims ahead of a big, hungry shark! It would come into the lagoon, and if it found anything good to eat, the big shark (the ship) would follow!\n\nTaori's village on the northern beach was hidden by trees, like a secret, so you couldn't see it from the entrance. She remembered that, a tiny spark of hope.\n\nThen, a sudden, warm bravery filled her heart. It pushed out all the fear! She would save Taori!\n\nShe left the trees and started running along the sand, her bare feet pounding softly, straight towards where the boat was coming. She would make the boat come to *her*. She wouldn't let it go near Taori!\n\nHave you ever seen a brave little bird try to lure a person away from its nest? It doesn't care about itself; it only wants to keep its tiny babies safe. That's exactly how Le Moan felt. She faced the unknown, which was scarier than anything she'd ever known, all because she wanted to save Taori, the boy she loved so much. Her love was so strong that her own fear vanished, melting away like ice in the sun.\n\nShe hadn't run far when the boat zoomed into the calm lagoon, pushed by the wind and rushing water, faster and faster! She waved her arms high above her head, jumping up and down, and the boat turned directly towards her! She stood still, like a statue carved from stone, watching it come closer and closer.\n\nIt was a plain white boat from the ship, with a tall mast and a billowing sail. Le Moan saw four men in it. Three were islanders with bare, strong shoulders, and one was a very big man with a dark, bushy beard. He wore a wide, straw hat, and his face looked dark and scary, almost like a monster's from an old legend. He wore an open shirt, and his sleeves were rolled up, showing his strong, hairy arms. *Gulp!* Le Moan swallowed hard.\n\nWhen the boat touched the sand with a gentle **scrape**, the islanders quickly jumped out. But Le Moan barely saw them. Her eyes were fixed on the huge man now standing on the beach. It was Colin Peterson, also known as Black Peterson. He was a trader, and he owned the big ship called the *Kermadec*. He looked fearsome and could get angry quickly, like a sudden storm, but he also had a tiny bit of kindness in his heart, like a hidden pearl. Poor Le Moan! She didn't know that yet. To her, he was just a big, scary giant.\n\nPeterson looked around at the empty, old houses and the quiet beach. Then he looked at Le Moan, his dark eyes studying her. He spoke in a gruff voice, in a language she didn't understand, then called out loudly, \"Sru!\"\n\nAn islander stepped forward. He had a fierce face and a necklace of small, white shells. After a quick exchange of words with Peterson, like a quick clap-clap, he turned to Le Moan and spoke to her. And she understood! The language of her island, Karolin, was similar to the language of this man's faraway islands. They could understand each other! Like a puzzle piece fitting perfectly!\n\n\"I am here alone,\" Le Moan said to Sru, her voice brave even though her knees felt wobbly. \"My people are gone. A big storm took them all away. There is no one here.\" As she spoke, her eyes quickly looked past Sru, towards the distant northern beach. She was so worried that Taori might go fishing by mistake and show himself. But nothing appeared, only the distant trees glowing in the bright sunlight on the water, still hiding their secret.\n\nShe knew the big ship was too far away and hidden by the southern reef for Taori's people to see it. She knew Taori would be busy building the canoes, **tap-tap-tapping** away. But the worried feeling in her heart made her repeat the words automatically, like a parrot taught to say a phrase. \"There is no one here but me. My people are gone; a storm took them away. I am here alone.\" As she spoke, she watched Peterson with quick side glances, like a little bird watching a big cat. She had never seen a man with such a big beard before, and this man, with his black, curly hair almost to his eyes, seemed like a monster from her deepest fears.\n\nWhile she was talking, the other islanders from the boat took two big, round water pots and began filling them at the well. It was the same well Le Moan had been looking into the day she first saw Taori, the water clear and cool.\n\nColin Peterson stood watching them. He had half-turned away from Le Moan, seeming to have forgotten she was there for a moment. Then, shielding his eyes with his big hand, he looked all around the lagoon. But he wasn't thinking about the men or the lagoon. He was very, very grumpy about Le Moan being there, like a growly bear who'd had his honey spilled.\n\nHe didn't know what to do with this girl. He had come ashore for fresh water on this quiet island, thinking he might find some people, but he never dreamed he'd find a *problem* like *her*. He couldn't just leave the lonely girl there all by herself, but what would he do with her on his ship, the *Kermadec*? If it had been a man or a boy, it would have been simple. But a girl? If he took her, he'd have to find her a home somewhere else, and that sounded like a lot of trouble!\n\nAs he stood there thinking and looking around, Le Moan kept watching him, this big man who seemed to be searching for Taori with his gaze, his eyes sweeping across the water. Would he believe her story? Would he hurt her? Old stories about scary outsiders filled her mind like bats flying in the dark, flapping their leathery wings. She didn't know what would happen next. She only knew she didn't care if he hurt *her*, as long as he believed her story and left without harming Taori. Her brave heart was beating just for him.\n\nThen, suddenly, when the last water pot was full, Peterson turned to Sru and shouted at him to bring Le Moan onto the ship. His voice was like a clap of thunder! When Peterson was confused, he became very, very grumpy, and Sru knew that when \"Big Feller Master Peterson\" started talking like *that*, he shouldn't waste any time. No time at all!\n\nSru grabbed Le Moan by the arm and pushed her towards the boat. For a moment, she tried to pull away, twisting like a slippery fish, but then she gave up and tumbled in, sitting at the front, near the mast. The whole thing felt like a strange, floating dream. She saw the men's strong shoulders and tense arms as they pushed the boat back out into the water. She felt the sand scraping **shush-shush** beneath the boat, and then the boat lifted, floating like a balloon, light as air! She saw the big white sail above her catch the wind and billow out against the blue sky, like a giant, soft pillow. She saw the white birds flying, and the calm lagoon, and the trees of the southern beach getting smaller and smaller as the boat headed for the ocean entrance. But always, and most of all, she saw Peterson's big hand as he sat at the back of the boat, steering, with his eyes looking at her, and beyond, like he was looking right into her thoughts.\n\nOh, the big sea! What amazing and sometimes sad stories it has witnessed, swirling and whispering! The sea of storms, crashing and booming; the blue, laughing sea, gentle and sparkling. Now, it looked lovely in the morning light, gently flowing through the gates of Karolin, lifting the boat onto the waves of the outer ocean. They passed the coral rocks where white birds cried above the foamy waves, their calls sounding like **scree! scree!**, and the waves seemed to answer their calls with a soft **whoosh!**\n\nIf Peterson had hurt Le Moan on the beach, she would have faced it bravely, without flinching a single muscle. Now, sitting and watching Karolin get smaller and smaller behind them, her eyes remained strong and steady. Even her fear of Peterson had completely disappeared. It was as if she had passed through a magic gate, leaving her old self behind and entering a new, strange place, full of adventure! A place filled with new sights, unlike anything she had ever known, waiting to be discovered.\n\nAs they got closer to the big ship, she saw its enormous white side, like a towering cliff, with a ladder hanging down like a long rope. She saw the railing, painted a clean white, and above it, the huge white sails fluttering and snapping in the wind. She saw the faces of men looking down from the ship at the small boat, like giants looking down at tiny ants. She saw Rantan, the mate, who had a kind smile, and Carlin, another man, who was busy with ropes.\n\nThen, she was on the ship's deck. It felt wide and white, like a new kind of beach, but one that was floating! Everything was so new and strange! This huge place felt like a new kind of land, rocking gently beneath her feet. A moment before, in the boat, the sea had been all around her, big and powerful. But here, the sea felt like nothing. This ship was everything, a whole world on its own. Taori, Karolin, the reef, the ocean itself \u2013 for a moment, it all disappeared, as if the *Kermadec* had swallowed it up like a bright light being swallowed by a big, wonderful whale.\n\nAnd after Peterson said a few words to his mate, no one on the ship paid her much attention. They were busy getting the small boat back onto the ship, hauling it up with ropes and creaking noises. As the rumbling of the canvas above quieted and the sails filled with wind with a great **whoosh**, she heard the voices of birds \u2013 birds from the reef and birds from the deep sea \u2013 flying behind the *Kermadec* as it started to move, slowly at first, then faster!\n\nLe Moan, feeling as if no one noticed her, quietly walked to the side of the ship. She saw the reef and the distant trees of Karolin, her home, and the birds from home, flying north and south, as if giving up the chase, saying goodbye. Then the reef disappeared beneath the sparkling water, and the sound of the reef and the birds' cries faded far, far away. The treetops of her island tried to hold onto her sight, waving goodbye, but they fought against the growing distance, until they were just tiny dots, and then they were gone, swallowed by the vast blue. Karolin was gone. But a whole new adventure was just beginning.",

Rantan's name made their brave hearts fall.\nNo hand would they lift against such a foe, a shadow too dark to fight.\nBetter to run, to the reef's soft arms, to Karolin's unsure safety in the night.\n\nPoni, the strongest, spoke his quiet wish for them to go.\nHeads nodded all around, a soft \"yes\" whispered in the quiet flow.\nLe Moan's laugh, a knowing bell. \"I saved you once,\" she promised, \"I save you now!\"\n\"Just wait, watch, my friends. And let your hearts open to my people, somehow.\"\nThen she rose up tall, like a silver pillar in the night's soft, gentle glow.\n\nFrom below, a sudden shout tore the still, calm air.\nA voice, broken and sleepy, from the dark door of the room down there.\nCarlin, caught in a bad dream, crying in his sleep.\nA little shiver went through the men, then calm. Just a dreamer making sounds deep.\nThey settled back down, hands flat on wood, eyes on Le Moan, watching her.\nShe moved, quiet as a breath, towards the hatch door, with no stir.\nIn her left hand, her spear point shone bright; her right hand touched the rail's soft blur.\n\nAt the dark hole's edge, she stopped, listening so very near.\nThe reef's deep song, the water's soft plink on the planks, she could hear.\nAnd from the darkness below, the soft breathing of men in sleep.\nThe stairs. A place she had always felt scared, a secret to keep.\nEven in daylight, it felt like a dark mouth, a trap, a heavy, squeezing weight.\nBut Taori's life, a precious little spark, waited there, sealed by fate.\nHers alone to snatch from death's cold, quiet, still embrace.\n\nKanoa watched, a new bright light shining in his face.\nThe fear that had held him tight now changed, leaving no trace.\nA brave spirit stirred, perhaps from his old family who fought and flew.\nA wild, happy feeling, like a dance, like music's strong arms, lifted him through.\nHe moved, a swift shadow, slipping past Poni's reaching hand.\nTo the rail he came, where Le Moan had vanished, like a magic band.\nSilent, with quick feet, he too glided to the hatch, and listened, in this strange land.\n\nLe Moan went down, step by careful step, her spear held very tight.\nA wave of ship air rose to meet her, from the room's deep night.\nThe smell of old men, of smoke, of dampness and ship's old, bad water too.\nIt twisted, like a mean ghost, stuck to her, tried to make her turn back, anew.\nShe, born of fresh winds, of sea-salt and wide, open skies, pulled away.\nBut her strong will, a stronger power, pushed her on, come what may.\nShe reached the bottom. Before her, a pale shape of light: the cabin door, day or night.\n\nInside, a swinging lamp made shadows dance and play.\nBeds lined the walls, men lost in deep sleep, come what may.\nMoonlight spilled from high, a silver beauty, soft and grand.\nFrom a bed, an arm hung down, Carlin's heavy arm in this quiet land.\nShe moved towards it, stopped, then froze, a silent, still stand.\nAbove Carlin, on the ceiling, on the wall, a quiet dancer, so close at hand.\nA great silver butterfly, soft and light, fluttering, shifting, light and free.\nA water-shimmer, a ghost of light from the lagoon outside, for all to see.\nIt held her for one quick breath, a spell woven in the dark.\nThen, her hand found his, and the spear made its swift, sure mark.\n\nA sharp cry broke the quiet in a flash.\nA sudden jump, a blur of speed across the table, like a sudden crash.\nRantan leaped. He grabbed Le Moan, threw her to the side, with a shout.\n\nAbove, Kanoa listened, his ears pulled tight, trying to figure things out.\nThe reef's calm hum, the water's soft touch on the wood, he could hear.\nThen, a high scream, a loud shout, a wild thrashing fight below, bringing fear!\nFear ran away. A new fire, hot and sharp, lit up inside his heart.\nHe plunged, a wild fall into darkness, playing a reckless part.\nTripped, fell, rose a little dizzy, and burst into the cabin's start.\n\nCarlin lay still, a heap on the floor, quiet as a stone.\nRantan, big and strong, held Le Moan against the table, not alone.\nHis knee pressed down, his hands at her throat, squeezing, making it hard to breathe.\nLe Moan's strength slowly leaving her, a sad, quiet wreath.\nKanoa jumped. Like a tiger's leap, onto the table, then onto Rantan's back so bold.\nThe grip shattered. Le Moan gasped for air, a story to be told.\nKanoa held tight, like a wild rider, hands to Rantan's neck, knees locked on tight.\nRantan roared, a choked sound, hitting blindly back in the fading light.\nHe stood up, wobbled, then crashed down to the floor so low.\nStill Kanoa clung, as they rolled on the floor, to and fro.\nHe held on until all moving stopped, a quiet, peaceful show.\n\nIt was all done.\n\nThe silver butterfly still danced, light and free, on the wall so high.\nThe reef's sleepy hum filled the quiet air, under the sky.\nNo other sound, no other stir, just peace all around.\nThen Le Moan, on the table, stirred and made a sound.\nShe turned, pushed herself up on an elbow, and then she understood.\nAnd slid softly to the floor, as brave as she could.\nRantan lay half on Carlin. Kanoa lay by Rantan, where they stood.\n\nKanoa stirred when she touched him, a little dazed, then rose up tall.\nRantan moved a bit, a tiny flicker of life, just a small call.\nLe Moan, kneeling, found a piece of cloth, soft and white.\n\"Tie him up,\" she said. \"Not dead. For my people, he's like a shark, caught in the night.\"\nFrom above, Poni's voice called out, a loud, clear sound.\n\"Scaredy-cat!\" Le Moan cried. \"Come see! The brave work is done, safe and sound!\"\n\"Yes!\" Kanoa, feeling very brave now, echoed her words from the ground.\n\nHe knelt by Rantan, who was tied tight, a sight to see.\nHis eyes looked at Le Moan, full of wonder, shining with joy and glee.\nHe did not know that this great work had been for Taori, special and true.\nTaori, next to whom, for Le Moan, all other men were just shadows, fading from view.\nLike the moon-born butterfly, still dancing high above the quiet, still men, new.",
